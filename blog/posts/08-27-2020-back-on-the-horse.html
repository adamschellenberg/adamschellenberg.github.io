        <p>Oof, I am <em>not</em> good at this whole blog thing. But, I know I need to get better. Documentation is so important for multiple reasons. And I'm seeing more and more the negative effects of its absence in my life.</p>
        <p>First benefit: memories. My kids are growing up so fast (as all do. Source: ask any parent). I want to remember little quirks about them. How they've changed. How they stayed the same. Funny things they used to say. Funny things they used to do. But, memory fades over time. If we don't document these things, whether through photos, journals, or videos, then one day, we'll forget, and that sweet, hearfelt knowledge will be lost.</p>
        <p>Second benefit: communication. My programs grow and develop so fast (as all do. Source: ask any programmer). I want to remember how I structured the code. How I expanded upon it. How I cut back and optimized. Features that seemed a little funny because I didn't know what I was doing. Funny ways I described things because I didn't know the right words. But, after you move on to a new project, you forget. You want to look back and remember how you implemented a certain feature so you can easily do it again and do it better, but if you don't properly document your code, you'll forget, and others will have a hard time helping or taking over.</p>
        <p>And really, I could be doing a lot better as a programmer if I documented my work, so I could look back on it during the next project and say "oh yeah, <em>that's</em> how I did that. Pfft. I can do that better now." And then you do it. And you become a stronger developer. Imagine playing Pokemon, and you gain all these levels, but every time you turn off the game, you lose some experience points, or even a few levels. You'd be frustrated to no end! Most people might flip the table and rage quit. I would (and rightfully so, I might add!). So if you (I) don't want that to happen with your coding skills, then you (I) need to get better at documenting. And fast.</p>
        <p>So this is me, getting back on the horse, picking up a few steps behind where I left off, and starting a more regular (fingers crossed) attempt at documentation. I want to use this platform that no one reads to write down what I'm learning, where I'm learning it, how I'm doing with it, and, most importantly, ways I can and have applied it. Not to quote the obvious and overquoted, but <em><strong>knowledge is power</strong></em>!</p>
