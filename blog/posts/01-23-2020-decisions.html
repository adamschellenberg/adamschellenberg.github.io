        <h2 class="display-4">Decisions</h2>
        <h6>01-23-2020</h6>
        <p><small>Minutes to read: 8 minutes</small></p>
        <br />
        <p>You know what suck sometimes? Decisions. Should I wake up early to exercise? How much chocolate milk should I drink for breakfast? Who should I take out of my party to add in Zacian? 
            Questions like these come into our minds every day, almost all the time. Life is a long string of decisions. Recently, I've struggled with a few. And, you know, it haunts me. Because sometimes, decisions are hard.</p>
        <p>In particular, the decisions I've had to wrestle with are between programming and family. First off, I love my family. I have an amazing, supportive wife, and my kids are, in my opinion, the two single greatest children I've ever seen. 
            There's no doubt that they are what is most important. But, I hate my job. I'm unhappy. Sure, the job itself, keeps me busy. And sure, the people I work with are pretty cool. But when I'm there, I have no <em>passion</em>. 
            And isn't passion something we all deserve out of our jobs? I mean, we're there for majority of our lives. I'm clocked in at work for more hours than I see my kids. So is it too much to ask to have a job that makes me as happy (well, as close as it can) as when I am with my family? 
            Again, I don't think so. And so, I began my journey to be a programmer.</p>
        <p>I'd known for a few years now that it's what I'd wanted to do as a career, but it wasn't until 2015 that I had the opportunity to begin learning. So I did. But then at the end of 2015 I got married, so I put a pause on it. 
            And when I was about to go back, my wife and I found out she was pregnant. Great news, of course, but that brought in fear. I decided to work hard at my current job in order to rise through the ranks and put us in a financially stable place. 
            And I did. I, as the youngest member of the department, became a team lead (the awkwardness of that is a topic for another time), through hard work and dedication. We were now financially stable. And it was mid-2016. A year and a half, gone.</p>
        <p>The realization of the time that had gone by was sobering. But apparently not enough. I decided to hold off a little longer. After all, my son was going to be born in just a few short months, and there was still a <em>lot</em> of things to prepare. 
            Well, he came, and he was (still is) every bit as awesome as I thought he would be. But then it was suddenly 2017.</p>
        <p>2017. Two years after I had decided it was time to learn to be a programmer. What did I have to show for it? A few 'Hello, World!'s and 'FizzBuzz's. If I was lucky, maybe even a cube in Unity that could move on a flat plane. Great. So much for that decision. 
            But, something finally did spark within me. I began to study on Udemy, learning a few fundamentals of andrpid development. By the end of the year, I had made a weather app, and a few small games. I had even done <em>two</em> freelance jobs! I was on fire. 
            That is, until my wife's second pregnancy began to be a little tougher than we expected. I set aside programming to help more with Levi, and with upkeeping the house. And before I knew it, it was 2018.</p>
        <p>And that's when I decided to get more serious. My daughter Annabelle was born early in the year, and suddenly, it was three years after the initial realization, almost nothing to show for it, and now, reflected in my children's eyes, a failure. I was ashamed. 
            Somehow, I had let life get the better of me. Who knows how long it had been since I last went for a job, or did a sit up. Who knows how much junk food I shoveled down day after day. How many times I looked at Visual Studio Code and decided to grab my Switch instead. I was <em>pathetic</em>. 
            I knew <em>something</em> had to change if I wanted to be the person that my children and wife saw me as.</p>
        <p>I decided to do something I enjoyed while getting back into programming. In the first half of the year, I had done a personal 6 hour game jam, participated in 1GAM, and made countless prototypes to learn how different game mechanics were developed. Throughout the rest of the year, I continued to fan the flames of my love for code. 
            In the second half of the year, I got together with my brother Jacob (a real-life professional programmer) and we held a 12 hour game jam. I made my own take on Pong. I wrote a program to help my department at work figure out exactly how many ornaments they would need to make a Christmas tree of their desired specifications! 
            Needless to say, 2018 was <em>my</em> year. I had decided that it would be. And that's how I rolled in 2019. </p>
        <p>Stinkin' 2019. The company I worked for had just laid off hundreds of staff. And then proceeded to buy out a fellow mortgage company. We. were. swamped. I did so much overtime and was so tired at the end of every day, that I couldn't bring myself to stare at a screen long enough to write an if statement. 
            And so began my downfall. Before I knew it, the end of the year had come, and I had another year wasted. At this point, I had a 25% success rate in productive programming years. Not that great. But work finally did slow down. And, in October, I got back together with Jacob and we began a project that brought back the spark: Words. 
            Still unpublished as of this post, but available on Github, Words made me remember that programming is fun. I started to learn React and, let me tell you, React is awesome. I love it. It brought me back from the grave. Somehow, in 2019, I managed to send out at least 50 resumes for programming jobs. 
            I didn't get a single job offer. But one of them did call me back and, after a thirty minute conversation, let me know the things I could improve on. It was actually less than I thought! My self-confidence shot through the roof.</p>
        <p>Now, here we are. 2020. A new decade. Insert vision joke here. I gave my (this) website a little polish. I cleaned up my Github profile. I've had many, many late-night conversations with my wife. And this year is my year. This decade is my decade. 2020 is not going to come to a close until I am carefully setting my Yami Yugi pop figure down on my new desk, as a programmer. 
            It took five years, but I made my decision. I will become a programmer <em>this year</em>. Why? Because <em>everyone deserves to have a job they love</em>, and I love to write code. Heck, to a small degree, I'm doing so even now. This is vanilla html that I'm writing this in. No framework, or fanciness. 
            Sure, there are more fancy ways of doing so, but I don't care. Programming is programming, and I love all of it. I want to learn all of it. And this year, I'm piecing together everything I learned over the last five years, and I'm putting it to the test. I'm expanding upon it. I'm growing. And I'm going to start my career as a programmer. 
            It's been decided, and I'm not turning back now.</p>
