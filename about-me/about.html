        <p>Adam is a pretty hard-working guy. He's got a wife, Jenifer, and two kids, Levi and Annabelle. He's been in love with programming for a long time now, and is always thinking up new ways he could use technology to better his and his family's life. </br>
        Adam has dabbled in a few different things within programming. C++ was his first time learning how to code, but he quickly made a switch to C# for game development. After playing around with that for a while, he discovered his passion: web development. And video games. And well, anything that involves coding. But mostly web development. </br>
        Outside of programming, Adam loves to be creative, whether it's painting, drawing, writing, baking, or asking his wife how to take a good photo.</p>

<!-- From old landing page:

  <h2>
    Who I Am
  </h2>
  <p>
    I am a laid back, fun-searching husband and father of two. My little ones Levi and Annabelle mean the world to me, and my wife Jenifer helps me to stay on track. Many people will tell you, I get distracted a lot. Like, a lot. But, those same people will also tell you that when I'm focused, I'm oblivious to all except the task at hand. In my opinion, nothing is more satisfying than compiling code and seeing it work. This is rivaled only by the thought "How can I do this better the next time?". I love to listen, learn, and teach. If I ask you too many questions, it's because you have knowledge I want to learn about. I can't help it. I'm a curious little monkey. </br>
	Here you will find all that I have done, am doing, and hope to do. Enjoy!
