<h1> Adam's Playground</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my website! Have a look around!</h2>
<p>I like to think of this as my virtual bedroom. Random things will be thrown here and there. Little things for entertainment will be added in occassionally. Whatever fits. I hope you enjoy!</p>

<h2>Who I am</h2>
<p>I am Adam Schellenberg, and I've got a beautiful wife and two awesome kids. I love programming, video games, and basically anything that is fun or challenging.</p>

<h2>What I'm doing</h2>
<p>Currently, I'm a team lead in the Disclosures Department at Movement Mortgage. My main responsibilities are to help the members of my team become increasingly efficient in their jobs, provide training where necessary, and help them and others in fellow departments with questions and scenarios that are difficult or out of the ordinary. I also assist two other team leads with these same responsibilities within their teams.</p>
<p>Outside of my day job (and usually during my lunch breaks), I love to program. I have been programming on my free time for about two years now and cannot seem to get enough of it. While I started by dabbling in Java and Android Studio, I shortly moved to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and web development. Currently, I am focusing most of my attention on C# and Unity. I have found that this is where I feel the most comfortable, though I have yet to try out a programming language I did not end up enjoying.</p>

<h2>What I've done</h2>
<p>No, this isn't a section for Linkin Park; it's my history. Where we came from is a large part of who we are, after all.</p>
