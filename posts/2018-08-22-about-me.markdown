Okay, it's a little more than sometimes. It's <small>(probably)</small> not entirely my fault, though. I currently work a day job as a team lead for the Disclosures Department at Movement Mortgage, but my heart and passion is in programming. I began to dive deeper into game programming at the beginning of this year, starting with a one-man, six-hour game jam, where I created a game I call Neon. At the end of 2016, I had the great experience of doing some front-end coding on the previous version of the 45 Tactical Designs website. I had my first taste of programming in high school, back in 2007 when I took an Intro to C++ class for a semester. Boy, were my eyes opened! And although the journey has been different than I expected, I can't wait to see what lies ahead.

So please, have a look around!
