Adam has a great passion for learning, programming, and, well, anything with technology. He's constantly asking "why...?" and "wouldn't it be cool if...?". Apart from programming, his family is his number one love in life. His wife Jenifer supports him to no end, his son Levi shares his love of Pokemon, and his daughter Annabelle keeps him in line.

If you like video games, education, technology, or dad jokes, you've met a good friend.

### Technologies
